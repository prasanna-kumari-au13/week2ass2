1. Eplain in detail what happens when you type www.google.com?
A.            There are series of events that happen when we type in www.google.com into browser’s address bar from a given location, we will cover few main steps here -

*User enters www.google.com into the address bar

*Browser checks if the typed address is www url or the search term, if it is search term then it 
          will use pre configured web search server (may be google or bing, etc) to search the typed term from web.

*If the requested Object is in browser’s cache and cache is valid, content is rendered from cache, otherwise

*DNS Lookup takes place - Browser resolves the IP address for the mentioned server (www.google.com)

 *It checks in the browser cache
           * Checks the OS Cache.
           * Checks the router cache.
           *Checks the ISP cach** DNS recursive search until it reaches authoritative DNS Server. 
                   If multiple ip addresses are found for a given server address, then DNS Round Robin algorithm picks up any one for the further communication. 
If it does not recognize the domain then it gives error message. We can use command on windows to check what all IP addresses are mapped to this www.google.com domain, 
incase they are multiple DNS server will use round robin algorithm to pick up any one from the list.
*Google.co.in receives the request the decodes the user and send the appropriate HTML response including headers (status code 200 OK, content type, etc)
*The Browser receives the response and begins to parse it for display. if it is compressed, browser will decompress it, The HTML body will include links to css, images, js. 
        All these links will trigger additional calls back to server to retrieve those files. CDN (Content Delivery Networks) may serve these static resource requests to speedup the process.
*Browser layout engine will start to assemble the final page for display. css, js information may alter the layout of the page.
*The final page is assembled and rendered to the user.
*After this the browser may send further AJAX request to communicate with the web server even after the page is rendered.


2.Difference between Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling?
A.        Horizontal scaling:
                     Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.   
            Vertical scaling:
                     Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
                         
               HORIZONTAL SCALING                                                                             VERTICAL SCALING
          *It expands the size of the existing system horizontally.	                    *It expands the size of the existing system vertically.
          *It is difficult to implement.	                                                    *It is easy to implement.
          *It expands the size of the existing system horizontally.	                    *It expands the size of the existing system vertically.
          *It is difficult to implement.	                                                    *It is easy to implement.
          *It is costlier, as new server racks comprises of a lot of resources.	     *It is cheaper as we need to just add new resources.
